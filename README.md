# Hangman

This is a simple Hangman game implemented in Python. The game selects a random word from a predefined list, and the player must guess the word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

## Features

- Random word selection from a predefined list.
- ASCII art displayed at various stages of the game.
- Streamlit integration for a web-based interface.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nishnarudkar/hangman.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd hangman
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


4. Run the game:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

- Run the script and follow the prompts to guess letters in the selected word.
- The game will display the current state of the word and the number of lives left after each guess.
- If the player guesses all the letters correctly, they win. If they run out of lives, they lose.
